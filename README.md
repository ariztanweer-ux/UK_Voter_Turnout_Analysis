# UK Voter Turnout Analysis by Age Group

Ever wondered why some people show up to vote every election while others barely bother? I explored UK voter turnout data across age groups to find out who participates, who fluctuates, and how voting patterns change over time.  

This project is built entirely in **Python**, using **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for visualization.

## What I Did

1. **Cleaned the dataset** and verified consistency.  
2. **Analyzed turnout changes** between consecutive elections to see which groups fluctuate most.  
3. **Calculated volatility** to identify the most and least stable voter segments.  
4. **Visualized turnout and volatility** to make patterns clear.  
5. **Measured contributions** of each age group to overall turnout swings.  
6. **Trend analysis** to see which groups are increasing, decreasing, or stable over time.  
7. **Cohort tracking** to follow how young voters behave as they age.  
8. **What-if scenario** to see the impact of improving young voter turnout.  
9. **Enhanced plots** with annotations to highlight peaks, drops, and volatility.  
10. **Summarized key takeaways** in a concise, clear manner.

## Key Insights

- Turnout **increases with age:** Older voters (55+) consistently have the highest turnout; younger voters (18–24) the lowest.  
- **Volatility decreases with age:** Younger groups fluctuate the most between elections; middle-aged (35–54) are most stable.  
- **Contribution to overall turnout changes:** 25–34 and 55+ age groups drive most of the changes; 35–54 contribute least.  
- **Trends over time:** Slight upward trend in 18–24 and 55+ turnout; middle-aged voters remain stable.  
- **Cohort tracking:** Young voters stabilize as they age, confirming age influences consistency.  
- **What-if scenario:** Increasing 18–24 turnout by 10% raises overall turnout from 60.53% → 61.74%, showing **strategic importance of engaging young voters**.  
- **Enhanced visualizations:** Annotated plots make patterns, peaks, and volatility immediately visible, improving clarity and professional presentation.
